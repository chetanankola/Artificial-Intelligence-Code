• -BFS
  Agent runs breadth-first search.
• -DFS
  Agent runs depth-first search.
• -Astar
  Agent runs A* search.
                                  2
• -UCS
  Agent runs Uniform-cost search.
• -stats
  Your program should output the following information in addition to the final path:
     – The number of nodes expanded.
     – The length of the final path.
     – The ratio of nodes on the final path to nodes expanded.
     – The estimate of the total cost (as determined by the heuristic) from the start to the end (h(startstate)).
• -AltH
  (Only used with A* search.) Agent uses the heuristic you designed (rather than Manhattan distance).
• -AltC
  (Only used with A* or UCS.) Agent uses bottom-favoring cost function.
